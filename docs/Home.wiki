== Introduction ==

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

The [[Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_description_document|OpenSearch description document]] format can be used to describe a search engine so that it can be used by [[Community/OpenSearch search clients|search client applications]].

The [[Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_response_elements|OpenSearch response elements]] can be used to extend existing syndication formats, such as RSS and Atom, with the extra metadata needed to [[Community/OpenSearch search engine directories|return search results]].
