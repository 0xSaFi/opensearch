## Notice

## Introduction

The OpenSearch Suggestions extension offers a convention by which search
engines can return a set of search term completions for a given search
prefix. The search completions can be used by a search client to
dynamically present the end user with search term suggestions.

## Background

The [Google Suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en)
project pioneered a mechanism for dynamically presenting a list of
search term completions as the user interacts with the search interface.
The [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) web browser incorporates
this technique into the browser search box to offer the user dynamic
search term suggestions. This document is based on the [Firefox Search
Service design
documentation](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Search_Service/Suggestions).

## Type

The following type is used to indicate that the response will contain
search suggestions:

  -   
    `application/x-suggestions+json`

## OpenSearch Description document

Search engines that support search suggestions can use the OpenSearch
Description document to publish URL templates for the search query.

### URL elements

`Url` elements of `type="application/x-suggestions+json"` should be used
by the client to retrieve search
suggestions.

### Example

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

` `<OpenSearchDescription xmlns="<nowiki>http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/</nowiki>">  
`   `<Url type="text/html"
         template="<nowiki>[`http://example.com?q={searchTerms}`](http://example.com?q=%7BsearchTerms%7D)</nowiki>`"/>`  
`   `**`<Url``
``type="application/x-suggestions+json"`**  
`        `**`template="http://example.com/suggest?q={searchTerms}"/>`**  
`   <!-- ... -->`  
` `</OpenSearchDescription>

## Search Suggestions Response

### Response Format

The response body should be returned in [JavaScript Object
Notation](http://www.json.org/) as a JavaScript array of arrays.

### Response Content

Search suggestions are returned as an ordered collection of values. The
four values are returned in the following order:

  - Query String
  - Completions
  - Descriptions
  - Query URLs

#### Query String

Description: A single element echoing the requested search term. The
search client may validate that this value matches the expected
response.

Required: yes

Example:

` "sea"`

#### Completions

Description: A list of suggested completions for the given search term.

Required:
yes

Example:

` "sears","search engines","search engine","search","sears.com","seattle times"`

#### Descriptions

Description: A list of human-readable strings that provide additional
information or context regarding the suggested completion.

Required:
no

Example:

` "7,390,000 results","17,900,000 results","25,700,000 results","1,220,000,000 results","1 result","17,600,000 results"`

#### Query URLs

Description: A list of URLs that should be used by the search client to
request the suggested search term at the corresponding position in the
completions lists.

Required:
no

Example:

` "http://example.com?q=sears","http://example.com?q=search+engines","http://example.com?q=search+engine","http://example.com?q=search","http://example.com?q=sears.com","http://example.com?q=seattle+times"`

### Example

The following is a full example of a JSON formatted search suggestions
response:

` ["sea",["sears","search engines","search engine","search","sears.com","seattle times"],["7,390,000 results","17,900,000 results","25,700,000 results","1,220,000,000 results","1 result","17,600,000 results"],["http://example.com?q=sears","http://example.com?q=search+engines","http://example.com?q=search+engine","http://example.com?q=search","http://example.com?q=sears.com","http://example.com?q=seattle+times"]]`
