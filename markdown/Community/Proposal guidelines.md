If you would like to contribute a proposal for a new [OpenSearch
extension
specification](Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions "wikilink"), then
please create a new page under the "Community/Proposal/" branch of the
page hierarchy.

For example, if you wanted to write an extension that would add
information about the color of each search result, then you might create
a page called:

  -   
    `Community/Proposal/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Color/1.0`

The path to your page should be contructed by prepending the prefix
"Community/Proposal/" to the path that you believe the page should
ultimately appear.

Please do not place your page directly in the Specifications tree, as it
will be moved the Community tree for public discussion and review. After
a suitable period of time and discussion, an administrator can move the
page into the final location.

If you would like to comment on a proposal, please use the "Talk" page
associated with the draft in question.
