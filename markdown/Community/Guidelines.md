## Getting started

OpenSearch.org is designed to offer the community a place to discover
and contribute to the OpenSearch effort.

This site is powered by [MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org), the same
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) software that is used to power
[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org). As such, it offers you, the reader,
an opportunity to contribute back.

If you would like to contribute, either by suggesting improvements and
corrections, or by adding new content of your own, you will first need
to create an account. Please use the [Log
in](Special:Userlogin "wikilink") form to add yourself to the list of
[OpenSearch.org editors](Community/OpenSearch_community "wikilink").

As the content on OpenSearch.org will be considered by many to be
canonical, it is important that we work together to offer only the best
advice for OpenSearch users.

Certain pages, such as the OpenSearch 1.1 specification itself, and any
other "permanent" page, are
[protected](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Protected_pages) to prevent
against unexpected changes. If you would like to comment on a protected
page, please use the associated [Talk
page](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk_pages).

## House rules

  - Please only post content related to OpenSearch.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        This site is here exclusively for information about OpenSearch.
        [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) is a great place for other
        topics.

<!-- end list -->

  - Please do not post spam or commercial content and/or links.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Doing so will get your account and your IP banned nearly
        instantly, so please, don't.

<!-- end list -->

  - Please respect other people and their work.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Use your best judgement if editing a page. Typos and grammar
        fixes are usually safe. Pointers to additional information are
        welcome (in the appropriate places). Please be especially
        careful if you are making an edit that could change the meaning
        or interpretation of existing work.

<!-- end list -->

  - Please do not plagiarize.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Be sure to give credit where credit is due.

<!-- end list -->

  - Please post content in the right place.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        If you would like to propose a new OpenSearch extension, please
        follow the [proposal
        guidelines](Community/Proposal_guidelines "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - Please err on the side of caution.

<!-- end list -->

  - 
    
      -   
        Use the Talk pages to ask questions if you are not sure about a
        change. It is much better to start a dialog than to see an [edit
        war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_war) break out.

## Reminder

A reminder that this is site is an optimistic experiment. If it turns
out that running a community wiki is subject to abuse then plans will
have to adjust accordingly. But in the meantime, thank you, have fun,
and welcome to OpenSearch.org\!
