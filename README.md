# What is OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

The most recent version of the specification is [OpenSearch 1.1 Draft
6](opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md).

You can access the complete original source wikitext content mirrored [here](mediawiki/), 
or view the last cached copy of the website on [archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20180101090350/http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1).

# What is this repository?

This respository is a migration of the opensearch.org website. The original source
export can be found in the [src/](src/) subdirectory, and the migrated files
can be found in the [mediawiki/](mediawiki/) subdirectory. The current version
of the specification has been ported to Markdown format and is available
[here](opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md).

# How do I get involved?

Generally speaking, the specification has been unchanged and stable for over a
decade, and is unlikely to change again at this point. However, if you see a
problem or want to suggest a modification, please feel free to [open an issue
on the issue tracker](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/issues) or [fork
the repository and send a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
