# What is OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.

The most recent version of the specification is available at [OpenSearch/Specifications/1.1/Draft 5](src/OpenSearch/Specifications/1.1/Draft%205).

# What is this repository?

This respository is a port of the opensearch.org website. The original source content can be found in the [src/](src/) subdirectory, and the ported files can be found in the [doc/](doc/) subdirectory. The specifications are also published as stand-alone pages [here](https://dewitt.github.io/opensearch/).


# Why was this repository created?

The opensearch.org website was originally created by A9.com in 2005 to host the contents of the OpenSearch specification under the terms of the [Creative Commons 2.5 BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) license. That site was maintained by the community from 2006 until 2018 using a MediaWiki instance hosted at a private ISP. This new git-based repository offers the same content in a modern hosting environment with better tooling and version control.

# How do I get involved?

Generally speaking, the specification has been unchanged and stable for over a decade, and is unlikely to change again at this point. However, if you see a problem or want to suggest a modification, please feel free to [open an issue on the issue tracker](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/issues) or [fork the repository and send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
